## Introduction

In React, side effects refer to any code that affects something outside the scope of the component itself, such as making API calls, manipulating the DOM, or subscribing to events. Handling side effects properly is crucial to ensure a smooth user experience and prevent memory leaks.

The useEffect() hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It replaces the lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

## What are Side Effects?

Side effects in React can include:

- Making API calls
- Modifying the DOM
- Subscribing to events
- Setting up timers or intervals
- Managing state outside of React

## Understanding the useEffect() Hook

The useEffect() hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It takes two arguments: a callback function and an optional array of dependencies.

The callback function is executed after the component has rendered. It can contain any code that needs to be executed as a side effect. The useEffect() hook also returns a cleanup function that can be used to clean up any resources created by the side effect.

The optional array of dependencies is used to control when the side effect should be executed. If the array is empty, the side effect will only run once, after the initial render. If the array contains values, the side effect will run whenever any of the values in the array change.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the useEffect() hook:
